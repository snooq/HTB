RSP + 4 --> RBP - 0x7c = 0x40  email length -> email must be less than 8 chars. If 8, 0a gets read

RSP --> RBP - 0x80 age

RBP - 0x84 - length of name from scanf


RBP - 0x74 - length of email


RBP - 0x78 - length of age


Signed int ranges:

0x80000000 is -2147483648 
0x7fffffff is 2147483647


0x70 -> 112 bytes to overwrite saved RIP

First 112-9 bytes must be alphanumeric
 
Buffer at EBP-0x60


Read syscall returns EFAULT -> out of bounds, read size > stack size

0x7fff7fffffff stack has to be in region lower than this address 


x64 alphanumeric shell code
